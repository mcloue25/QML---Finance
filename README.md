# QML---Finance
This repository explores a hybrid classical–quantum learning architecture for financial time-series regime detection. A classical neural encoder extracts low-dimensional features from market data, which are processed by a variational quantum circuit and benchmarked against strong classical baselines under realistic noise and data constraints.
