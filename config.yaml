### Design Rationale

- Classical neural networks efficiently extract temporal structure from time-series data
- Quantum circuits act as:
  - Nonlinear feature maps
  - Structured kernels
  - Expressive but constrained transformations
- The entire model is trained end-to-end using gradient-based optimization

## Quantum Component

### Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC)

- Parameterized single-qubit rotation gates
- Fixed or learnable entanglement layers
- Measurement via expectation values

### Training

- Hybrid classical–quantum backpropagation
- Automatic differentiation
- Optimization under small qubit counts

Experiments are conducted using **quantum simulators**, with optional noise models to approximate real hardware behavior.

## Baseline Models

All quantum-enhanced models are benchmarked against strong classical alternatives, including:

- Logistic Regression  
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)  
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks  
- Transformer encoders  
- Gaussian Mixture Models (for regime discovery)  

A quantum model is considered meaningful only if it:
- Matches or exceeds classical performance under controlled conditions, or  
- Exhibits clear qualitative benefits (e.g., stability, regularization effects)

## Evaluation Metrics

- Classification accuracy and F1 score  
- Temporal stability across rolling windows  
- Regime persistence and transition behavior  
- (Optional) Sharpe ratio when linked to a simple trading proxy

## Analysis Focus

The primary contribution of this project lies in **analysis rather than raw performance**.

Key questions examined include:

1. **When does the quantum layer help?**
   - Small-data regimes
   - Noisy feature spaces
   - Low-dimensional embeddings

2. **When does it fail?**
   - Increasing circuit depth
   - Hardware noise
   - Overfitting due to expressivity

3. **Economic interpretation**
   - Regime consistency
   - Sensitivity to risk drivers
   - Stability over time

Negative and null results are documented explicitly.

## Optional Extensions

- Quantum kernel methods and kernel-based classifiers  
- Portfolio optimization via QUBO / Ising formulations  
- Uncertainty modeling and regime ambiguity  

These extensions are secondary to the core benchmarking study.

## Project Philosophy

This repository adheres to three guiding principles:

1. **No hype** — quantum methods are treated as experimental tools, not magic solvers  
2. **Strong baselines** — classical machine learning is the reference standard  
3. **Economic relevance** — results are interpreted through a finance-first lens

## Intended Audience

- Quantitative researchers  
- Machine learning engineers in finance  
- Researchers exploring near-term quantum machine learning  
- Students seeking realistic, non-hype QML projects

## Disclaimer

This project does **not** claim quantum advantage or computational speedup.  
Its purpose is to **critically evaluate hybrid classical–quantum learning methods** under realistic assumptions.
